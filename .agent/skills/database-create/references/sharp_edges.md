## Missing Index Production

### **Id**
missing-index-production
### **Summary**
Adding index to large table locks production writes
### **Severity**
critical
### **Situation**
Adding index to table with millions of rows
### **Why**
  CREATE INDEX on a 100M row table takes minutes to hours. During this
  time, all writes to the table are blocked. Your API returns 502s,
  users see errors, and you can't cancel without leaving partial state.
  
### **Solution**
  1. PostgreSQL: Use CONCURRENTLY (slower but no lock):
     CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_email ON users(email);
  
     Note: Cannot run in transaction, may fail and need cleanup
  
  2. MySQL: Use pt-online-schema-change:
     pt-online-schema-change --alter "ADD INDEX idx_email (email)" D=db,t=users
  
  3. Plan indexes BEFORE deployment:
     - Design indexes based on query patterns
     - Deploy with migration before traffic hits
  
  4. For urgent fixes, consider:
     - Blue-green deployment with pre-indexed replica
     - Maintenance window with user notification
  
### **Symptoms**
  - API timeouts during migration
  - Lock wait timeout exceeded
  - Database connection exhaustion
### **Detection Pattern**
CREATE INDEX(?!.*CONCURRENTLY)|ALTER TABLE.*ADD INDEX

## N Plus One Orm

### **Id**
n-plus-one-orm
### **Summary**
ORM lazy loading causes N+1 queries
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
Loading related data through ORM
### **Why**
  users = User.objects.all()
  for user in users:
      print(user.orders.count())  # 1 query per user!
  
  100 users = 101 queries. 10,000 users = database meltdown.
  ORMs default to lazy loading, which is convenient but deadly at scale.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Use eager loading:
     # Django
     users = User.objects.prefetch_related('orders')
  
     # SQLAlchemy
     users = session.query(User).options(joinedload(User.orders))
  
     # Prisma
     const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
       include: { orders: true }
     });
  
  2. Use database views for complex reports:
     CREATE VIEW user_order_stats AS
     SELECT u.id, COUNT(o.id) as order_count
     FROM users u LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.user_id = u.id
     GROUP BY u.id;
  
  3. Monitor query counts per request:
     Django Debug Toolbar, pg_stat_statements
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Page loads get slower as data grows
  - Database CPU spikes during list views
  - Query logs show repeated similar queries
### **Detection Pattern**
for.*in.*:.*\..*\.|\.all\(\).*for

## Select Star

### **Id**
select-star
### **Summary**
SELECT * fetches unnecessary data
### **Severity**
medium
### **Situation**
Querying tables with many columns or large fields
### **Why**
  SELECT * FROM articles includes the 50KB content blob even when
  you just need titles. Network bandwidth, memory, and parsing time
  all wasted. On a list of 1000 articles, that's 50MB unnecessarily.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Always select only needed columns:
     SELECT id, title, created_at FROM articles;
  
  2. Create projections/views for common cases:
     CREATE VIEW article_list AS
     SELECT id, title, author_id, created_at FROM articles;
  
  3. In ORMs, use field selection:
     # Django
     Article.objects.values('id', 'title', 'created_at')
  
     # Prisma
     prisma.article.findMany({
       select: { id: true, title: true, createdAt: true }
     })
  
  4. Exception: When you actually need all columns
  
### **Symptoms**
  - High network I/O between app and database
  - Slow queries for "simple" operations
  - Memory pressure in application
### **Detection Pattern**
SELECT \*|findMany\(\)|\.all\(\)

## No Foreign Keys

### **Id**
no-foreign-keys
### **Summary**
Missing foreign keys allow orphaned data
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
Multi-table relationships without constraints
### **Why**
  Application bug deletes a user but not their orders. Now orders
  reference user_id that doesn't exist. Your reports break, your
  joins return wrong counts, your data is corrupt. And it's been
  happening for months before you notice.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Always define foreign keys:
     CREATE TABLE orders (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id)
     );
  
  2. Choose ON DELETE behavior carefully:
     - CASCADE: Delete children with parent (use for owned data)
     - RESTRICT: Prevent parent deletion (use for referenced data)
     - SET NULL: Nullify reference (rare, for optional relations)
  
  3. Add foreign keys to existing tables:
     -- First, clean up orphans
     DELETE FROM orders WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM users);
  
     -- Then add constraint
     ALTER TABLE orders
     ADD CONSTRAINT fk_orders_user
     FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id);
  
  4. Monitor for constraint violations in logs
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Joins return fewer rows than expected
  - Reports show inconsistent totals
  - NULL where data should exist
### **Detection Pattern**
CREATE TABLE(?!.*REFERENCES)|user_id.*INT(?!.*REFERENCES)

## Uuid Random Index

### **Id**
uuid-random-index
### **Summary**
Random UUIDs cause index fragmentation
### **Severity**
medium
### **Situation**
Using UUIDv4 as primary key on high-write tables
### **Why**
  UUIDv4 is random. Each insert goes to a random place in the B-tree
  index. The index becomes fragmented, requires more pages, more I/O.
  Performance degrades over time. 100M rows with random UUIDs is
  significantly slower than sequential IDs.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Use UUIDv7 (time-ordered):
     -- PostgreSQL 17+ has gen_random_uuid() for v4
     -- For v7, use extension or application-side generation
  
  2. Use ULID (lexicographically sortable):
     -- Similar benefits to UUIDv7
  
  3. For high-write tables, consider bigserial:
     id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY
  
  4. If you must use random UUID, use fill factor:
     CREATE INDEX ... WITH (fillfactor = 70);
  
  5. Regularly REINDEX or rebuild indexes
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Inserts get slower over time
  - Index size larger than expected
  - Full table scans faster than index scans
### **Detection Pattern**
gen_random_uuid\(\)|UUID.*PRIMARY KEY

## Transaction Too Long

### **Id**
transaction-too-long
### **Summary**
Long transactions hold locks and block others
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
Complex operations in single transaction
### **Why**
  BEGIN; ... process 10,000 items ... COMMIT;
  This transaction holds locks for minutes. Other queries wait,
  connections pile up, timeouts cascade. One slow operation blocks
  the entire database.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Break into smaller transactions:
     for batch in chunks(items, 100):
         with db.transaction():
             process_batch(batch)
  
  2. Set transaction timeout:
     SET statement_timeout = '30s';
  
  3. Use advisory locks for coordination:
     SELECT pg_try_advisory_lock(123);
     -- Do work
     SELECT pg_advisory_unlock(123);
  
  4. For long processes, use background jobs:
     - Celery, Sidekiq, etc.
     - Each job is short transaction
  
  5. Monitor long-running transactions:
     SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity
     WHERE state != 'idle'
     AND xact_start < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 minute';
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Lock wait timeout errors
  - Connection pool exhaustion
  - Sudden spike in query latency
### **Detection Pattern**
BEGIN.*COMMIT|transaction.*for|\.atomic\(\).*for

## Jsonb Overuse

### **Id**
jsonb-overuse
### **Summary**
JSONB for structured data loses query power
### **Severity**
medium
### **Situation**
Storing frequently-queried data in JSONB
### **Why**
  data JSONB contains {"user_id": 1, "status": "active", "amount": 100}
  Every query needs to parse JSON. Indexes are complex. No referential
  integrity. No type checking. You've built a document database inside
  a relational database, with neither's advantages.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Extract frequently queried fields to columns:
     ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN status TEXT;
     UPDATE orders SET status = data->>'status';
  
  2. Keep JSONB for truly dynamic data:
     CREATE TABLE products (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         name TEXT NOT NULL,
         price NUMERIC NOT NULL,
         metadata JSONB  -- Only for optional, varying attributes
     );
  
  3. If you must query JSONB, add expression indexes:
     CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status ON orders ((data->>'status'));
  
  4. Consider when to use JSONB:
     - User preferences (read as whole)
     - Plugin/extension data
     - Schema-less by requirement
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Slow queries on JSONB fields
  - No foreign key errors (silent data issues)
  - Complex query syntax
### **Detection Pattern**
JSONB(?=.*user_id|.*status|.*email)|->>['"]id

## No Pagination

### **Id**
no-pagination
### **Summary**
Unbounded queries return millions of rows
### **Severity**
high
### **Situation**
API endpoints or reports without pagination
### **Why**
  GET /users returns ALL users. In development: 100 users, 10ms.
  In production: 5 million users, 30 seconds (if it doesn't timeout),
  gigabytes of JSON, crashed browser, dead API server.
  
### **Solution**
  1. Always paginate:
     SELECT * FROM users
     ORDER BY created_at DESC
     LIMIT 20 OFFSET 0;
  
  2. Use cursor pagination for large datasets:
     -- Instead of OFFSET (slow for large pages)
     SELECT * FROM users
     WHERE created_at < $last_seen_timestamp
     ORDER BY created_at DESC
     LIMIT 20;
  
  3. Add reasonable maximums:
     const limit = Math.min(args.limit || 20, 100);
  
  4. For exports, use streaming:
     COPY (SELECT * FROM users) TO STDOUT WITH CSV HEADER;
  
  5. Cache counts separately (COUNT(*) is expensive):
     -- Cache or estimate, don't compute on every page
  
### **Symptoms**
  - Timeout on list endpoints
  - Out of memory errors
  - Slow page loads as data grows
### **Detection Pattern**
SELECT.*(?<!LIMIT).*;|findMany\(\)(?!.*take)
